👋 Hi, I’m @karenwhite33, an AI Engineer applying a decade of audio engineering expertise to ML & NLP, building AI that extracts meaning and optimizes decision-making. 

I fine-tune transformers like LLaMA and BERT for code generation and semantic analysis while developing multimodal AI systems, from medical imaging to CNN-based predictive modeling. 

My focus is on scalable AI solutions that turn unstructured data into business insights. My trasnfered skils strengthens my ability to create intuitive, human-centered AI experiences.


I’m passionate about machine learning, deep learning, large language models, and AI-powered content creation. My hands-on experience includes designing dense networks and CNNs for multimodal tasks, improving accuracy by synchronizing tabular and image data pipelines.

I specialize in data preprocessing, transfer learning, feature fusion, and hyperparameter optimization to refine model performance. Through iterative improvements, I’ve consistently achieved measurable gains over baseline metrics, combining creativity with technical expertise to address real-world challenges.

My goal is to leverage my unique perspective, problem-solving skills, and emerging AI knowledge to drive impactful projects and solve complex challenges across various industries.
